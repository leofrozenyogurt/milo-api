## Contributing to Milo

1. Fork the project.
2. Make your feature addition or bug fix.
3. Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
4. Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull).
5. Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
6. Dont be mad.
